Pairing is a big part of how we develop software at Influitive. We've been pairing nearly as long as the company has been around, and it's had a huge impact on the quality of our code and how we work together as a team.

## A brief history

Despite taking a lot of inspiration from the Extreme Programming movement at Influitive, early on pair programming seemed like a bizarre ritual practiced by zealots who were a bit too interested in the "extreme" part of pair programming. It's a seriously counterintuitive thing to get your head around - *obviously* reducing the amount of "hands on keyboards" by half has to carry some cost in terms of productivity. We bought into the idea that quality would probably improve, but early on in the company's history that was less of a concern - we were more tuned to moving fast and breaking the occasional thing than ensuring high quality at all times.

At the same time, we were seeing some amazing success from other companies like Extreme Labs (now Pivotal) pair programming religiously. We tried experimenting with pairing now and again, encouraging developers to pair when they were working on something particularly difficult. But it wasn't really clicking.

We decided to try an experiment.

Like a lot of companies working in an "agile-ish" environment, we track the velocity of our teams against story point estimates for what we're working on. We wanted to understand just how much productivity loss we would actually encounter from pairing 100% of the time. We decided to run with it for a month. Because our estimates were made before this experiment was even proposed, we figured it would truly represent how much pairing slowed us down.

After our second week, something incredible happened. 

Our velocity was exactly the same as it was when we had developers working independently. We were moving just as fast with pairing as we had been without. We quickly joined the ranks of the zealots.

## Pairing today

We've learned a bit about pairing in the 4 years that we've been doing it, and our opinions and philosophy about pairing have evolved. While we definitely went through a period of pairing in 100% of circumstances.
