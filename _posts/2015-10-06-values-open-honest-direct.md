For me *open, honest, and direct communication* is the cultural
underpinning which allows Influvians to work well together and
with our partners.  In a business context we strive for effective
communication in an atmosphere where people are encouraged to
share ideas; openness, honesty, and directness are useful starting
points for business communication.

*Directness, honesty,* and *openness* all improve communications
and in combination they reinforce each other fostering an atmosphere
of trust.  There are no hidden agendas and we can collaborate easily.
It’s a non-competitive style of communication which has many benefits
in my experience:

* When both parties in a conversation are being *open* and *honest*,
  then it’s easier to explore ideas and stumble.  Both people have
  an interest in the outcome, and all mistakes offer some learning
  and opportunity to re-evaluate assumptions.
* The *openness* of communication creates an atmosphere where people
  with a contribution to make are happy to speak up, even across team or
  hierarchical  boundaries.  This helps mix perspectives, and provides
  the opportunities for unexpected innovation from someone with
  unique insights or experience.
* In conjunction with the *team productivity not individual glory*
  core value, Influitive’s resultant culture encourages sympathetic
  active listening.  There’s no loss in helping your fellow Influvian
  refine and develop their ideas.

I find that keeping *directness* in mind improves the clarity of
my communication, because it helps me focus on the ideas I’m trying
to communicate *and* helps me restrain my urge to embellish the
message.  Crafting a concise, direct message respects other people’s
time, and reduces the chance of miscommunication.

The combination of *openness*, *honesty*, and *directness* forms a solid
foundation for effective communication, which leads to benefits
including:

* Developers have a shared, effective style of communication in and
  across squads.
* The *openness* fosters an environment without barriers for
  communication so that any employee, no matter how junior or new,
  feels able to talk to anyone else in the company.  This has deep
  consequences for many types of formal and informal information
  exchange.
* We can discuss the vision that the company has, and our plans to
  make that vision real.  There are many opportunities at squad
  meetings and off-sites to ask how things are going and make
  contributions.

An example of open communication across teams is the chart on the
wall behind finance.  It’s a frequently updated chart of a team’s
financial goals showing how we are meeting them.  Another example
is the celebration of closed deals at the daily sync-up meeting.
These help me to know how Influitive’s doing, and I feel confident
that I can ask about anything if I have any concerns.

The most important area of communication to me is around personal
development.  In my one-on-ones and my work, goals, and progress
discussed candidly during the year and that makes it easy to have
course corrections and adjust to changing circumstances.  The
*directness* of communication helps with focus, and the *openness*
and *honesty* during the yeear means there aren’t surprises in the
review.

Developing a straightforward and honest communication habit has
benefits outside Influitive too.  It is much easier to work with
partners and customers in an atmosphere of trust, and *open*,
*direct*, and *honest* communication is a good foundation for
trust.

Over my career I have become more sensitive to whether a company
has explicitly stated core values, **and** whether they seem to play
a major role in people’s daily life at a company.  A well chosen 
set of core values support each other, and the company’s
culture arises from the personalities of the individuals who share
a respect for the core values.  I think that *open, honest, and
direct communication* is the foundational value for our culture at
Influitive, in that it builds trust and supports the other values.

At influitive we keep our values in mind by recognizing someone
for their contributions at our daily sync-up meeting.  This
recognition is tied back to one (or more) of our values, so everyone
is exposed to them on a daily basis.

I hope this has piqued your interest in Influitive’s values. In future
posts I will investigate our other values.
